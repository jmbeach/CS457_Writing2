# Outline
1. Introduction to the topic of NoSQL DBs
	+ Definition
		+ Professional Nosql
			+ NoSQL's name infers that it opposes SQL
			+ "NoSQL is used today as an umbrella term for all databases and data
stores that don’t follow the popular and well-established RDBMS
principles and often relate to large data sets accessed and manipulated on a
Web scale"
	+ Advantages
		+ Clark 18
			+ Column-stored NoSQL databases can store many different attributes in the columns without hurting performance
		+ devbridge web
			+ NoSQL aims to solve the object-relational impedence mismatch problem
			+ Despite the existance of Object-relational mapping frameworkds, the
			  developer still has to devote time to figuring out the best way to
structure the database.
		+ oaister web
			+ "Object-relational impedance mismatch is the
term we use to refer to a difference between the schema of an
object-oriented program and the schema of a relational
database"
				+ This means that fitting a relational schema into an object-oriented
				  schema is difficult.
